[%# This is a list of terms that may be changed to "brand" the Bugzilla 
  # instance (for example, referring to "bugs" as "issues".) When used, these
  # strings are used in several different types of content, and are not  
  # protected with Template-Toolkit FILTERs. Consequently, no special 
  # characters are allowed.
  #
  # Remember to PROCESS rather than INCLUDE this template. 
  #%]

[%# Note on changing terms:
  # Changing this will not affect "linkification" of your new terms.
  # This means if you change "bug" to "problem", then if you have
  # "problem 3" in a comment, it won't become a clickable URL.
  # To have that feature, you must edit the quoteUrls function in
  # globals.pl (in the base Bugzilla directory).
  # Change the line:
  # my $bug_re = qr/bug\s*\#?\s*(\d+)/i;
  # to something like:
  # my $bug_re = qr/(?:bug|problem)\s*\#?\s*(\d+)/i;
  # (here "problem" was used instead of bug - substitute as needed!).
